# Asteroidz

This project is a game built for Uppsala University's User Interface Programming II (1MD003) course.

Our application is an asteroid shooting game based on Asteroids by Atari. Players are able to move their ship around the screen and shoot at asteroids. The goal of the game is to gain points by shooting asteroids without getting hit by an asteroid.

## Platform

To build this project, we have used the platform Unity. We chose this platform for its ease-of-use, versatility, and vast resources / tutorials. Throughout our project, we found that Unity was difficult to collaborate on and there were many merge conflicts. Additionally, there was a steep learning curve with the platform. However, we believe that in the end we have created a cool and fun game for users to play.
